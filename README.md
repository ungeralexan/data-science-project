##  Project Goal
Turn unstructured university mailing-list messages into a **centralized, personalized event feed**, so students no longer miss:
- talks
- workshops
- deadlines
- student group events
- department announcements

All events will be extracted automatically and displayed in a clean frontend UI.

##  Email Ingestion (current architecture)
We use a **central project Gmail inbox** (`tuevent.project@gmail.com`) as the single source of truth.
